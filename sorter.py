#This file is in charge of recommending other skills and technologies based on
#user's resume, and searched input. Additionally, priorities jobs in order based on 
#the skills in the user's resume

#Team members: add any documentation notes for changes and etc. Thank you!
# - This document needs to be connected later on to data base and parsed info from
#   inserted resume

#jobs that could pop up
